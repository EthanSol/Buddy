Our development currently consists of only 2 developers who live in the same house and usually code side by side. Thus, we are currently just working directly in master. In theory, we could have branches for individual features or bugs, but with only 1 effective developer unit, this adds unnecessary red tape.

If you are an external contributor though, then please make a separate branch with a name describing the feature/bug on which you are working. Then, make a PR when you are ready for review. :)
